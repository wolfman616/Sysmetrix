Plan to add functionality to modify Metrics values temporarily until next theme (re-)application. Most are derrived from current msstyles theme / DPI context.

Plan to add call optional theoretical SysMetricsforDPi in some form. For instance: a dropper tool dragged and released over over target applications to reveal potentially new dpi-related values if present.
